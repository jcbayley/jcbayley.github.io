Education
======
* Ph.D in Physics and Astronomy, Glasgow University 0ctober 2016 - June 2020
  * STFC funded PhD titled {\it Non-parametric and machine learning techniques for continuous gravitational wave searches}. The main focus was to develop a fast method based to search through large data-sets for sources of continuous gravitational waves. For this I was awarded the Kelvin thesis prize from the University of Glasgow.
* Msci Astrophysics, Royal Holloway University of London, September 2012 - June 2016
  * Courses included: Stellar Astrophysics, General Relativity \& cosmology, Particle Astrophysics etc. Overall Percentage: 71% (1st)

Work experience
======
* August 2021 - present: Research Associate
  * University of Glasgow
  * Research duties include, developing data analysis techniques for searching for and inferring properties of Neutron stars and Black holes. 

* Nov 2019 - Aug 2021: Research Assistant
  * University of Glasgow
  * Research duties include, developing data analysis techniques for continuous gravitational wave searches. 

* Feb 2018 - June 2018: Research Fellow
  * Located at LIGO Livingston detector, I worked with others developing software titled Armadillo, the aim was to model the digital control systems of LIGO.
