I'm Joe Bayley a research associate at the University of Glasgow, primarily focussing on developing machine learning methods to help search for and characterise gravitational wave signals.

I completed my PhD at the university of Glasgow in 2016 where I developed methods to search for isolated neutron stars in gravitational wave data [soap search](https://github.com/jcbayley/soapcw) and how to estimate their astrophysical parameters with machine learing. Since then I have continued research at the univeristy of Glasgow developing methods to characterise gravitational wave signals and systems.
